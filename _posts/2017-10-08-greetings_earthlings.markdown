*Yes, Greetings Earthlings. Hello World seemed a little too easy. *

*Disclaimer: this post is a bit of a cushy introduction. There will be more code talk as we go along. /Disclaimer*

Growing up, there were a few things I knew for sure:  my mom was incredibly creative, my father was intensely logical, and I took after my mom.  I was – and still am – a writer, a storyteller, and a creator. For the longest time, I was content in that box, and I never ventured out of it. Math? Nope. Science? Never. Coding? Absolutely not. In my mind, it was too logical, too precise, and my brain didn’t function that way.

This way of thinking has influenced most of my decisions to date. I studied journalism at Carleton University, and then completed a post-grad degree in screenwriting. Today, I’m working at a local charity as their communications coordinator. 
Until, one day, I stumbled on CodeAcademy. One thing about me that tends to transcend my pigeonhole is my love of learning. I can’t help but become engrossed in learning new things.  But this time, something was different. I wasn’t coming back to CodeAcademy again and again just for the love of learning, but the love of code. I was coming back because I’d discovered something I never expected – coding was creative. I had only ever seen the logic, but now I see the ability to take nothing and make something new and exciting. Once I found Flatiron, I realized I'd started a life-long relationship with coding. 

When your side-hustle starts to take up more time than your job, it's time to re-evaluate your priorities. When I realized I wasn't just finding spare time to do this - as we speak, I'm writing this from my cottage - I realized it was time to make a change. It was time to dedicate myself to at least *trying* to become a developer.

This blog will document that journey. The good, the bad, the stuck, the rubber duck - all of it. 

I hope you enjoy the ride as much as I do.
