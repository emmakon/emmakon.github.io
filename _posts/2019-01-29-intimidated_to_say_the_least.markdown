If you ever speak to a programmer - like a real, honest-to-god, works for a living programmer - they'll tell you they spend just as much time googling errors as the amateurs. And I believe them. At least, logically I do.

But that doesn't seem to compute when it comes to my animal brain. You see, I hit a snare, a snag, or a nasty, seemingly unsolvable error, and I get discouraged. The voice chimes in: "Maybe you're just not made to code. Maybe your brain doesn't work that way." I stop doing the lessons out of frustration, and it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy.

And so, I've turned into the Queen of starting and stopping this course. It's frustrating, it's demoralizing (especially when you have to backtrack a few lessons to remember what you last learned), and it's so unnecessary. It's a cycle I'm just coming to realize, and it's why I'm putting it down in my first blog back (so less technical talk here). Because I have to get that negative goblin off my back and just  plough through. 

It's time for Google and I to become intimately acquainted. Just like a real, honest-to-god, works for a living programmer, I can't stop, won't stop until the error is solved.
