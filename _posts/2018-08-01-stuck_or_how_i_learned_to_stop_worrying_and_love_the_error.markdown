This blog post is a bit different, since I'm not focusing as much on actual coding, and more on what has *stopped*  me from coding in the past. 

Perfectionism.

It's the kiss of death in coding, or at least it can be. Expecting your code to come out perfect the first time you type "Learn". Feeling like if you don't understand a concept right away, you'll never get it. Fighting that urge to go back and re-do labs until you could do them in your sleep, because only once you can do them without error do you finally believe you understand the concepts (spoiler: that's not how it works).

Like other kids were always good at sports, or theatre, or band, I was always really good at school. At learning. I was the definition of a nerd, and I don't mind saying it. But, it also led me to believe that everything I learned would be easy. Coding isn't like that. Even when I'm doing things right, I might still get an error. And, slowly, I'm learning that's okay. I'm still on the right track.

Coding doesn't need perfectionism. It needs diligence. It needs dedication. It needs that bit (or large streak) of tenacity to keep pushing through, combing through, and fixing all you bugs.

It's a compplete mindshift, but one I'm making gradually. And, eventually, I feel like I'll get to a point where I won't throw anymore errors, and I'll arrive at my destination a little sooner than before. But for now, it's all about the journey.
